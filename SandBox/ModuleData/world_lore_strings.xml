    <!-- for queen rhagaea - you may wonder why it matters. under a good king or an evil one, landlords will rape their tenants' daughters, watch captains will demand bribes from merchants, masters will beat apprentices, husbands will beat wives
	Well, perhaps it does not matter. But the common people - if the good king triumphs, even if it costs tens of thousands of lives, they will tell it to future generations. That right beats wrong. And perhaps the wrongdoers will be a bit more afraid, perhaps the righteous will be a bit bolter.
		
    Lucon says he fights for the return of the old laws, that prevented tyranny. I do not believe that.
    Garios says he fights for his own men. Him I believe
    
    The Empire... Learned to love it.
    So long as the ruler is from one faction, there will be war.
    Men fight civil wars because they cannot stand to see one from the other faction lifted above them, to see his imitators in their alleys elevated by his glory.
    Do not think it will end with the death of Garios or Lucon.
    The ruler must come from above. I am not aristocrat nor populist. I am a foreigner. I am the memory of a dead man, my husband, a cold man who gave no one is full counsel.
    

  Mentor:
  "Arenicos is a man of genius with one great flaw: he believes everyone understands him when he speaks. He thinks that when he talks for three hours before the Senate, the Senators have followed every word and grasp the urgency of what he says, not that they applaud because he is Emperor."
  "Most men do not break with tradition lightly. Gario does. But he does not grasp that when he makes his daring moves, it is no longer so daring, and his rivals will soon imitate him. And thus, the unspoken contracts that have tied together our Empire fall apart."
  "Lucon sees us weak, when we were once strong, and the outer kingdoms strong, when they were once weak. He believes, as a man who cares nothing of events outside the Empire, that the cause is entirely within ourselves - we have abandoned our old traditions, and grown weaker. It does not occur for him for an instant that barbarians have learned our tricks, and grown stronger. "
  "Rhagaea knows she would be a good Empress, and that the time is right to establish that a woman can inherit. Believe me, I am the last to dispute that only men can sit on the throne. But if Rhagaea is empress, then it is only one easy step for her mad daughter Ira to inherit it,

From the birth of our empire until only 100 years ago, the Senate chose the emperor. The Senate could remove him. Any emperor who went against the Senate was a tyrant.
We were remiss in our duty. We thought of wealth and trade, and we did not assemble as often as we should. The emperors began choosing their children and comrades to follow them, and we acquiesced.
You have seen what happened in the past 100 years: we have had some good emperors, some bad ones, and some lunatics. A strong Senate is the only reliable barrier both against tyranny.
Arenicos was a good emperor, all told. But if he indeed named Rhagaea his heir, and that is not just a lie, it shows that even the best of men may be seized by madness. The daughter of the former Padishah? How do we know she won't just serve us to her people on a plate.
People like Garios hate the Senate, calling it corrupt and that it blocks any change. He would have the army proclaim the emperor. I respect our men; I would even call them heroes.

I am fighting because the Emperor Arenicos named me, the mother of his children, as his heir. That is how it has been done the past 100 years. The Senate are a bunch of greedy squabbling rich old men, and there is good reason why the people no longer accept them as their masters.
I do not proclaim any lofty cause. Whoever wins this war, landlords will cheat tenants, city guards will demand bribes from merchants, warriors will rape farmers' daughters, husbands will beat wives. The plague and the flux will take more lives than all the evils of man put together.
I will strive to be a good queen. I will pursue policies that I believe to be sensible, such as persuading the Aserai and the Khuzait to accept imperial citizenship and join us rather than harass our frontiers. But I can offer no guarantee that my heir, or my heir's heir, will not be a monster. 
I could marry Lucon or Gario, and save thousands of lives. But men are willing to fight for me, though it gains them nothing, for no other reason that the throne is my right. I will not betray these men.
If I win, in centuries to come, people will think back on my victory and think, "Heavens smile on those who fight for truth."

Lucon's philosophy
I am fighting not for myself, but because this empire went wrong, and I am going to turn it back to how it should be.
From the birth of our empire until only 100 years ago, the Senate chose the emperor. The Senate could remove him. Any emperor who went against the Senate was a tyrant.
One hundred years ago, the emperors stopped going before the Senate, and started naming their heirs themselves. The Senate was weak at the time. We acquiesced, so as not to split the empire, but we never accepted. Nor did we have the right, even if we had wanted, to sign away a right and a duty given to us by the Heavens.
You have seen what happened in the past 100 years: we have had some good emperors, some bad ones, and some lunatics. A strong Senate is the only reliable barrier both against tyranny
Arenicos was a good emperor, all told. But if he indeed named Rhagaea his heir, and that is not just a lie, it shows that even the best of men may be seized by madness. The daughter of the former Padishah? How do we know she won't just serve us to her people on a plate.
People like Gario hate the Senate, calling it corrupt and that it blocks any change. He would have the army proclaim the emperor. Gario is a scoundrel,  but I will do him the honor of taking his proposal seriously. I respect our men; I would even call them heroes. But they are easily enough swayed by a ration of free wine and a good speech. Letting them choose the emperor is the rule of the mob. 
If I win this war, I will reestablish the Senate's authority over the emperor. 
(people think a strong emperor who can do whatever he wants makes a strong state. opposite is true. must be sure never to lose an army.)

Gario's philosophy

I want everyone in the Empire to know that there is no better way in life to get ahead than to become a soldier. I want to hand out land. I want to give them pensions when they retire. I want them to hold high public office. And they should get to choose the Emperor.
I don't know if Arenicos really named Rhagaea as Empress, or if that's one of her lies, and I don't care. What I do know is this: I don't want this empire run by a Padishah's daughter. It needs a soldier-emperor. It needs me.

"It is a sad fact of the world that the lives of some are valued more than the lives of others. If laws to fly in the face of reality, this may cause many unforeseen problems. For example, if a lord may be hanged for the wrongful death of a commoner, then men will not fear him, and he will be unable impose justice in his lands."
Mercy +1


Trial by jury
"Juries can be bought. Or they may rule with their hearts not their heads. The application of the law will become random and arbitrary."
Mercy +1

Urban rights
"If it becomes more difficult to impose taxes on the cities, then kings will squeeze the countryside."
Mercy +1


Serfs
"It is a mercy to keep them tethered to the land. For people who are ignorant of the world, freedom is merely the freedom to wander, to be robbed, to fritter away one's money, and ultimately to starve in a ditch."
Mercy +1

Slaves
"It may seem cruel to deny a slave the right to buy his freedom. But many do not know how to make use of their freedoms, and such laws will merely see our cities flooded with desperate penniless men."
Mercy +1
"Let the low-born know their place. To give them the right to leave their land will encourage them to be insolent to their betters."
Mercy -1



Cosmopolitan negative
"People should keep to their separate ways. Let not the lion breed with the hyena."

ImpEd +1, 


Women's inheritance
"If women can control their own property, they will become targets for conniving fortune-hunters, or they will become as merchants themselves and lose their natural graces. Better leave such things in the hands of men, who are accustomed to the rougher aspects of the world."

"That's one good law that the empire has. There are some things that are a man's job, and some things that are a woman's."
