Party travel speed depends on a number of factors. Generally bigger parties are slower because they are more likely to lose marching order or get clogged in choke points. Parties that are overburdened by carrying too many goods also get slower. You can increase party speed by keeping horses in the inventory." />

Armies have an advantage over singular parties since they can hold a greater number of troops and display better coordination. The leader of an army will have to set it up first by spending {INFLUENCE_LINK}. Each army has an {ARMYCOHESION_LINK} stat which is crucial to its operation. An army will be disbanded automatically if its cohesion drops too low." />

  <!-- Personality Traits -->
  <string title="{=7NnPxNXZ}Personality Traits" id="str_game_objects_personality_traits" group="GameObjects" link_id="PERSONALITYTRAITS_LINK" text="{=U29XvRU6}Personality traits represent a character's reputation. They affect your relations with everyone in your realm, and possibly even your enemies too. For NPCs, they also represent the character's assumptions about what succeeds in the world: should you rigidly keep your oaths, or is everyone flexible and promises are for suckers? Should you plan every move with a long-term goal in mind, or will people not trust you if you don't show a bit of emotion? The traits are: Valor/Caution, Mercy/Cruelty, Honor/Deviousness, Generosity/Disloyalty, and Calculating/Emotional. Generally the first of these is viewed more favorably than the second, but not always: Generous leaders, loyal to their troops, are great for commanding armies, but you might want a judge to be a bit more impartial. NPCs' personality traits are fixed, whereas you, the player, will develop your traits by your actions within the game. More information is available about the individual traits as you mouse over them." />

  <!-- Influence -->
  <string title="{=RVPidk5a}Influence" id="str_campaign_issues_influence" group="CampaignIssues" link_id="INFLUENCE_LINK" text="{=aaPVmfMo}Influence represents the contribution of a character to the success of their faction, usually earned mostly by fighting in wars. You also gain a bit of renown simply by virtue of holding and governing a fief. It represents political capital, dues paid, favors in the favor bank - all the terms used to represent the currency of power. You spend it on compelling people to assist you in your campaigns, do you favors, and support your candidacy for titles and fiefs. No one is ever compelled to give you what you want when you spend influence - but you do put them under a moral obligation, and they'll look bad if they don't." />
  <!-- Silver -->
  <string title="{=CzhaQCK0}Money" id="str_campaign_issues_silver" group="CampaignIssues" link_id="MONEY_LINK" text="{=wybXag9U}The silver imperial denar is the standard currency of Calradia. Even the most far-flung tribes know what they look like, and can usually tell if they've been cut with baser metals. Gold is generally too valuable to be used in transactions other than those between kingdoms or great lords. You'll need money in the game for virtually all your basic needs - equipment, food, raising and maintaining troops - and it can also come in handy in politics and quest-solving. There are some things that money cannot buy, but you also don't get those things for free. For example, warriors risk their lives for pride or revenge, out of love of their homes or their commanders, status or adventure. Only the most cynical of mercenaries only care about the silver. But even the most loyal expect some payment as a token that their sacrifices are not going unnoticed. During rebellions, few lords will change sides for as crass a bribe as a bag of gold. But if they do decide you'd make a better king than the current one, a bag of gold can help offset the risk they're taking on your behalf. Calradians rarely keep all their money on their person or in one place. Some of your wealth will be in your purse or traveler's chest but much will be buried, otherwise hidden, or left with someone you trust. Some wealth will be in the form of letters of credit from merchants. In the game, it's assumed that anyone can get access to their money at all times, but the amount that can be taken from you in any one robbery is limited." />
  <!-- Renown -->
  <string title="{=aZxHIra4}Renown" id="str_campaign_issues_renown" group="CampaignIssues" link_id="RENOWN_LINK" text="{=iM2J0vav}Renown represents the perception of a character's importance, derived both from their birth and their deeds. The higher a character's renown, the more they are expected to take precedence in the affairs of their faction. It differs slightly from influence, in that influence represents the titles, lands, and honors that a character ought to be given, while renown represents what the character actually has. Influence also does not transfer from realm to realm - if you fight for Battania, the empire doesn't owe you anything - whereas renown does translate - if you're a VIP at home, you're also usually a VIP in other kingdoms. Renown gains you access to important people, gets nobles to treat you as a peer (or a potential spouse, in some cases) and eventually may even get people to start thinking of you as a potential ruler." />

Governors grant significant bonuses to the settlement according to their skills and perks. Governors will usually choose perks depending on their personality, so a rigidly incorruptible but harsh governor might yield different results than someone more likely to return a favor to an old friend, even if it means turning a blind eye to wrongdoing.  You can try assigning different people as governor in town management window and see how various stats change." />

  <!-- Kingdom Laws -->
  <string title="{=3fdylwA6}Kingdom Laws" id="str_campaign_issues_kingdom_laws" group="CampaignIssues" link_id="KINGDOMLAWS_LINK" text="{=GoF2sYNt}Kingdom laws represent the key decrees and institutions that make one realm different from another. All kingdoms are assumed to have some things in common: ordinary criminal laws against murder and theft, a ruler, an important social role for big landowners and aristocrats - but the specific laws will determine the balance of power. They often affect characters' influence, but can also affect income or a settlement's economic or military traits. Laws are generally divided into three categories depending on the three types of government envisioned by the ancients: monarchy, oligarchy, or democracy. Centralizing laws help the ruler keep the realm together but can result in tyranny, legalist laws allow the realm to settle disputes peacefully but can be exploited by the powerful to protect their position, and egalitarian laws increase the number of people participating in decisions but can sometimes lead to social disorder and mob rule. Laws can make an empire stronger but can also tear it apart, just as the Roman Republic was ravaged by civil wars between oligarchs and populists in its final century, until, exhausted, it fell into the hands of the basically monarchical emperor Augustus." />
