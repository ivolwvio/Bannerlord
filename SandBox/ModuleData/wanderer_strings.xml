    <string id="backstory_a.spc_wanderer_empire_0" text="{=3yK4uXyt}I'm an engineer. Most of us learned our trade and got our contacts through the army. It was a good system: it was the emperor's money, so the emperor's servants kept a close eye on us. But as everyone knows, the emperor ran out of money. The lords are in charge of fortifications now, and all they have to go on is the say-so of other engineers." />
    <string id="backstory_b.spc_wanderer_empire_0" text="{=OYOwasMe}You can imagine - it's a bit of a racket. People build arches that fall down, and his colleagues go on recommending him because he's someone's brother or old apprentice. The greatest sin in our brotherhood is criticizing the work of other engineers. " />
    <string id="backstory_c.spc_wanderer_empire_0" text="{=JfTTbPag}Well, I don't play that game. If something's going to fall down and kill someone, I'll point that out. So, naturally, all my 'brothers' cut me out of contracts." />

    <string id="backstory_b.spc_wanderer_empire_3" text="{=DzyAgYIX}But Drosios Neretzes led the pick of the legions into an ambush in the Battanian woods. You may have heard that story.

    <string id="response_1.spc_wanderer_empire_3" text="{=0SnKUaex}No doubt a sad state of affairs. So what do you do?" />
    <string id="response_2.spc_wanderer_empire_3" text="{=WQCAanal}Ah, the old days. And no doubt back then they complained about the older days. I've heard enough." />
    <string id="backstory_d.spc_wanderer_empire_3" text="{=RdiZT1Gb}Well, I can't just sit around and drink myself to death, so I sell my sword to anyone worth following.

    <string id="generic_backstory.spc_wanderer_empire_3" text="{=GLXrkZbW}I'm a soldier of the imperial legions.

    <string id="backstory_b.spc_wanderer_empire_4" text="{=xZuqLfE7}But I was young and foolish. Bandits - well, who'd have thought? They're real animals. Always drunk and stabbing each other, or too drunk to feel cold so they catch the plague and end up coughing up blood, or drunk and asleep when the patrol comes around so they end up on the gallows - I suspect you get the idea." />
    <string id="backstory_c.spc_wanderer_empire_4" text="{=qgmt8aPz}So that was no kind of life, neither. I left the woods, paid a little money to friends who got my name off the outlaw list, and now I'm a regular law-abiding citizen. Officially, that is." />

    <string id="backstory_a.spc_wanderer_empire_6" text="{=R9KivNZ6}You may have heard of Ladimos the Red. He preached that the Heavens were getting ready to unload their wrath on landowners and merchant, that we had to drive them out and live pure lives and we'd be rewarded with a Pure Emperor, come down from the skies. This was some 10 years ago. Well, a lot of us ran off to follow him, some of us believed him and some of us had debts and some just wanted to take a lick at those that oppressed us." />
    <string id="backstory_b.spc_wanderer_empire_6" text="{=7JMaPpkN}We built a great temple in the back country, out in the bush, called it the Kingdom of Truth. We whipped two imperial detachments sent to track us down. But Ladicos died, 'Called up to Heaven' he said on his deathbed, and then we lost our way a bit. We needed food and we needed money, so our chiefs started collecting 'taxes' from the villages below. Some started taking money from lords and merchants for protection of caravans. And those who grumbled - well, they started turning up dead in the dry streambeds." />
    <string id="backstory_c.spc_wanderer_empire_6" text="{=7caHipXX}So I left. And a short while later the emperor sent a third detachment, bigger than the others, and that was the end of the Kingdom of Truth. My old comrades - I see them sometimes from time to time, some in a lord's retinue, others in a cage with R for 'robber' branded on their forehead." />
    <string id="response_1.spc_wanderer_empire_6" text="{=wk1jPh1S}A sad tale." />

    <string id="backstory_d.spc_wanderer_empire_6" text="{=HcMbaZn4}I learned a few skills up in the hills, how to follow a trail and spot an ambush, most useful to caravaneers. So I reckon I can probably stay ahead of the hangman. A regular job wouldn't hurt, though." />
    <string id="generic_backstory.spc_wanderer_empire_6" text="{=DIaT6pXi}Aye, well, once I was a rebel up in the back country, but rebels never last too long. Now I just want to serve and get paid. You've been around. You've met men like me before, I'm sure." />

    <string id="backstory_a.spc_wanderer_empire_7" text="{=qVQdEYyJ}My family had debts so I joined the army. I guess I always liked men's work more than women's work. The legions took hill women as scouts but I was never the hidey-sneaky type. So I did what I did to be in the spear line." />

    <string id="response_1.spc_wanderer_empire_7" text="{=8CixQpyO}Well, there's always work for the brave and the resourceful." />
    <string id="response_2.spc_wanderer_empire_7" text="{=bhvZuX1m}A rather sad tale of deceit and disgrace." />
    <string id="backstory_d.spc_wanderer_empire_7" text="{=TzOdlTeb}Yeah.. The merchants give me jobs. But I'm not sure I care much for guarding caravans. A lot of sitting around listening to boring talk about prices." />

    <string id="backstory_b.spc_wanderer_empire_8" text="{=OGyYFIEA}The guardsmen came to burn our neighbor's house, so their debts would be forgotten. The flames spread to our house, and it was destroyed. My father tried to save his strongbox, and that was his undoing.

We tried to find shelter with my uncle, but there was no food in the city, and he turned us out. So we joined the refugees in the country, living on what we could steal from the fields. " />
    <string id="backstory_c.spc_wanderer_empire_8" text="{=aNSIajhR}I found a guardsman, alone and drunk. I have no idea whether he was one of the ones that set fire to our neighborhood. Maybe I should not have done to him what I did to him. But now I have his sword. It's been very useful." />

    <string id="backstory_a.spc_wanderer_empire_9" text="{=Aqbu1o9v}Far back as I remember, I was living on the streets of {IMPERIALCAPITAL} with a bunch of other dirty, barefoot scrogs. A group of men in our alley, they called themselves the Centaurs, I guess they took a liking to me. Gave me special errands to run from them - started with picking pockets, ended with sticking knives into their enemies. Back then I'd do anything for a handful of figs and cheese and a pat on the head." />
    <string id="backstory_b.spc_wanderer_empire_9" text="{=imBWFomj}Got a bit older though, and their interest in me changed. Filthy drunken louts pressing themselves against me, grabbing at me - I wasn't having that. Made up my mind to leave, but wasn't sure where to go." />
    <string id="backstory_c.spc_wanderer_empire_9" text="{=axnObjSY}Then came the day that {IMPERIALCAPITAL} burned, and everyone was out looting and robbing, and that was my chance. Lifted a bag of silver from the Centaurs' stash and lit out on the road." />

    <string id="backstory_b.spc_wanderer_empire_10" text="{=pzK7TN05}But one day I was contacted by an agent of the Bureau of Barbarian Affairs. I do not know how well you know them. Their original mission was to keep the foreign tribes divided and weak, but they expanded their remit into all the affairs of the empire, anything that might be deemed a threat. At first they wanted small harmless details about my patients. To do so was a violation of my oath, but I was anxious to have the favor of the Bureau. But soon they began to call on me for more and more." />
    <string id="backstory_c.spc_wanderer_empire_10" text="{=sfFLudTM}One time they came at midnight - they had a man who plotted against the Emperor, they said, and they needed a confession, and wished me to use my art to elicit that confession.

I went with them, to my shame, and what I was asked to do to that man's body -- I shall not repeat it." />

    <string id="backstory_a.spc_wanderer_khuzait_6" text="{=mSQSZyEF}You probably know that the Khuzaits once lived out on the open grass. But our khans became used to luxuries. They lived in cities, and wished to trade with and make war upon other kings. Khan Urkhun, whom some call the Great and others call the Cruel, decided the clans must live in fixed places, so he could count their warriors and levy them, and count their flocks and tax them. Thirty years ago Khan Urkhun ordered all the clans of the Khuzaits to claim land and live upon it, and the noyans to build castles. Most complied, for they had come to value their comforts more than their freedom." />
    <string id="backstory_b.spc_wanderer_khuzait_6" text="{=phhXgKRm}Some resisted. The Karakhergit - you may have heard of them. They still dwell in the steppes but they are outcaste, raided for slaves by the others. My people were the Uvait. We were broken up - some bands were lured into the villages with silver, others were hunted down, defeated, and their sons taken as hostages. " />
    <string id="backstory_c.spc_wanderer_khuzait_6" text="{=TxQztLfy}I am one of those whose clan was hunted down a generation ago when they refused the decree of Urkhun Khan, that they must settle and be taxed. They took our flocks, and we have since lived like beggars on the edge of the towns. The far grass teases us with its beauty, but if we went there with no sheep, we would soon starve." />
    <string id="response_1.spc_wanderer_khuzait_6" text="{=TVQEb0MJ}Such a cruel decree..." />
    <string id="response_2.spc_wanderer_khuzait_6" text="{=YDPpShfF}Sensible man, that Urkhun. Nomads are the enemy of order." />
    <string id="backstory_d.spc_wanderer_khuzait_6" text="{=sbK6AEjB}I have scraped together a few coins. I will not say how, but they were enough to buy a sword. I am determined to earn enough to buy my people what was taken away from them - herds. I am sad to say I know little of the steppe, but I know much of the towns, of the back streets, of how to live in the gutters and shadows and grow strong." />
    <string id="generic_backstory.spc_wanderer_khuzait_6" text="{=BxJA6fS5}Urkhun Khan decreed a generation ago that all the Khuzaits must settle, to be conscripted and taxed. We refused. His men took our flocks, and we have since lived like beggars on the edge of the towns. I have resolved to go out and earn the money we need to buy new flocks, and then we shall go again into the great grass, beyond the reach of any tyrant or khan." />
    <!-- enslaved, used as amazon -->
    <string id="prebackstory.spc_wanderer_khuzait_7" text="{=g3BssthL}Oh yes. I do indeed have a story to tell you." />
    <string id="backstory_a.spc_wanderer_khuzait_7" text="{=TgN0DvXA}Slavers took me when I was a girl. The Empire were legends of warrior-women out in the deep steppe, and when I was sold, they claimed I was one of these - to fight other slaves, to entertain them by making their legends come true." />
    <string id="backstory_b.spc_wanderer_khuzait_7" text="{=3Yax10rQ}Well, perhaps there is something to those legends, because I did very well for myself, and made my master very rich. Imperial law now decrees that men are not allowed to kill in the arena, but no one pries into what happens at the private entertainments of the rich, and over a score of my fellow slaves must have felt my blade in their chest." />
    <string id="backstory_c.spc_wanderer_khuzait_7" text="{=Gnczyx1v}I feel no guilt - they were trying to kill me, and some came very close. I did what I needed to do." />
    <string id="response_1.spc_wanderer_khuzait_7" text="{=CQq51L8J}Yes, I suppose you did what you had to do." />
    <string id="response_2.spc_wanderer_khuzait_7" text="{=rZs4HKkc}Necessity or not, you seem to take pride in what you did." />
    <string id="backstory_d.spc_wanderer_khuzait_7" text="{=tpPE2Ert}There's not much more to say. My master was a sadistic animal but he let me keep my winnings, and eventually buy my freedom. I think he may also have realized that eventually, had he kept me against my will, he'd have ended up with a severed neck vein. So here I am, looking to make a living through the only means I know - shedding other people's blood. Got work?" />
    <string id="generic_backstory.spc_wanderer_khuzait_7" text="{=ifkJcbZu}I was enslaved by imperial raiders and taken to the city. I was bought by a nobleman, who had me fight other slaves for his personal amusement. But I purchased my freedom, eventually, and now intend to enjoy it." />
    <!-- lone daughter of mother -->
    <string id="prebackstory.spc_wanderer_khuzait_8" text="{=iK5Kaa7M}Well, if you wish to know how cruel a pack can be to one of its own, I could enlighten you." />
    <string id="backstory_a.spc_wanderer_khuzait_8" text="{=lbLBkvoe}My father died shortly after my mother became pregnant with me. I was her only child. Like most of our people, she had wanted sons. So she raised me as a son, and boasted of me like she would boast about a son. When I was a baby, she boasted of how swiftly I emptied her breast of milk. When I was a girl, she boasted of how I killed steppe ducks with my bow. When I became a woman, she boasted that soon I would be the first of my age-set to bring home the head of an enemy slain in battle." />
    <string id="backstory_b.spc_wanderer_khuzait_8" text="{=piHbGBbA}Because I loved my mother, and because I was faster and stronger than the boys, I did all that she said I would do. Of those born in my year, I was the first to kill an enemy. My mother boasted even more, so that the other women came to hate her. They turned us all out of our encampment. We were forced to sell our lands and our slaves, as we could not take them with us, and we were given but a fraction of the price. All we had was our sheep. Of course raiders found us soon enough, and killed my mother, and took our flock. I escaped." />
    <string id="backstory_c.spc_wanderer_khuzait_8" text="{=J7dPH9cj}I wandered a bit on the steppe. I starved a bit. But I followed the raiders and one, when he went beyond the campfire to empty his bladder, did not return. I now have his purse and his sword." />
    <string id="response_1.spc_wanderer_khuzait_8" text="{=IyGObqs1}I'm sorry for your loss. You drew a cruel lot in life." />
    <string id="response_2.spc_wanderer_khuzait_8" text="{=28RfiykG}Every day, I give thanks to the Heavens that I was not born a savage." />
    <string id="backstory_d.spc_wanderer_khuzait_8" text="{=548o0GKu}I could return to my people, I suppose, but I have no wish to do so. So I am here, in the towns, where I can make good money with my sword and care nothing about those who envy me." />
    <string id="generic_backstory.spc_wanderer_khuzait_8" text="{=TIYbctCQ}My father died shortly after my birth. I was my mother's only child. Our clan was poor, and a woman with a baby - especially a girl-baby - was only a drain on what little they had. So we were sold to another clan, as servants. Some years later, when my mother died, I stole one of their swords and one of their horses and rode off into the grass." />
    <!-- tomboy daughter of caravan guard -->
    <string id="prebackstory.spc_wanderer_khuzait_9" text="{=W5MlHm8t}Sure. You can't sell a horse if you don't shout its praises, as they say." />
    <string id="backstory_a.spc_wanderer_khuzait_9" text="{=Xe2pVmnX}I was the brat of a caravan guard. Never knew my mother, but my Da kept me close. I grew up running between the legs of camels on the steppe, eavesdropping on merchant gossip in the sarais, eating sesame cakes bought me by the other guards. A happier childhood you couldn't imagine." />
    <string id="backstory_b.spc_wanderer_khuzait_9" text="{=TAC5Tnx4}But when I got older, well, it wasn't so easy to take me on the road. Too many boys giving me funny looks. And my Da, he wanted a good husband for me, but the boys he knew weren't the marrying type. So I said to him, 'I'll be like you, Da, carry a sword and guard rich merchants. And maybe, with the money I earn, some decent boy will love me for my dowry, if not my family name.' He fussed a bit about that but he had no better ideas." />
    <string id="backstory_c.spc_wanderer_khuzait_9" text="{=KyiL4Hvs}So here I am. Guess I'm not so interested in the marriage part, but I like the denars and I like my freedom. Maybe some day I'll surprise my Da with a nice farm and a couple of slaves to keep him happy in his old age." />
    <string id="response_1.spc_wanderer_khuzait_9" text="{=bLZVseMd}I'm sure he'll be happy if you're happy." />
    <string id="response_2.spc_wanderer_khuzait_9" text="{=MlXbCLlO}You must have broken your poor father's heart." />
    <string id="backstory_d.spc_wanderer_khuzait_9" text="{=A6WrXPQ6}So like I said: I can ride, swing a sword, manage a caravan, and I have good idea how to turn a profit. You know anyone looking to hire someone like that?" />
    <string id="generic_backstory.spc_wanderer_khuzait_9" text="{=GT1ubyEr}I was the child of a caravan guard. I spent my babyhood swinging from a sling on the side of a camel, and my childhood chasing strays. But caravans are preyed upon by bandits and others, and I decided I don't like being prey. I reckon I have the skills to be a predator." />
    <!-- horsethief, former karakhuzait -->
    <string id="prebackstory.spc_wanderer_khuzait_10" text="{=tfEfmvBt}Mm. Oh yes, you may." />
    <string id="backstory_a.spc_wanderer_khuzait_10" text="{=Iedpguoa}I grew up in a village not far from here. But you know how the tribes from the steppe look down on those who till the land. Trampling our crops, hauling us off to war, sitting their in the saddle looking pleased with themeselves as we grub in the mud." />
    <string id="backstory_b.spc_wanderer_khuzait_10" text="{=wxfJIDtt}At any rate, that wasn't the life for me. So I made up my mind to run off to the grasses, find one of those tribes that doesn't answer to the khan and takes in fugitives. The Karakhuzaits, they call them. Problem is I first needed a horse." />
    <string id="backstory_c.spc_wanderer_khuzait_10" text="{=EJKa1wQS}Anyway I hung around the marketplace in Chaikand, looking for a likely candidate. Eventually I found an animal whose owner hadn't tied up too well as he went off to get drunk. So I took it and ran. And you know what? The cursed beast threw me, not one league out of town, and ran back to his sodden master." />
    <string id="response_1.spc_wanderer_khuzait_10" text="{=Xxu37bB8}Oh well. I guess you've got spirit." />
    <string id="response_2.spc_wanderer_khuzait_10" text="{=MIBESua8}Hah! May all thieves fail as you did." />
    <string id="backstory_d.spc_wanderer_khuzait_10" text="{=R6P8JauE}Anyway, I guess I need a new plan to make my way in the world. But I'm not going to be a farmer, I'll tell you that much. One way or the other, I intend to ride and fight and find my place among the hawks of the world rather than the pigeons." />
    <string id="generic_backstory.spc_wanderer_khuzait_10" text="{=aCaH6sMX}I grew up on a farm but that's not the kind of life I want to live. I want to learn to fight and ride. There are a lot of us lads like that in the Khuzait lands, I think you'll find, even if the great horse lords think we're fit only to push a plough." />

    Garios: We will never have peace until there is an Emperor whom the soldiers love. What do they want? A leader who trains them hard, fights them hard, and rewards them generously. I intend to do that.
    The Heavens know I loved Arenicos. I shed his blood for them. But his dream of peace with our neighbors was moonshine. You can have war on the frontiers or war at home. I prefer war on the frontiers. Let the men earn glory, gold and slaves.

    Lucon: The Senate chooses the Emperor. That is our law. It has been twisted, broken, or ignored for 100 years. But it has never been changed. Without law, there is but tyranny and the mob.

    Rhagaea:
I am fighting because the Emperor Arenicos named me, the mother of his children, as his heir. That is how it has been done the past 100 years. The Senate are a bunch of greedy squabbling rich old men, and there is good reason why the people no longer accept them as their masters.
I do not proclaim any lofty cause. Whoever wins this war, landlords will cheat tenants, city guards will demand bribes from merchants, warriors will rape farmers' daughters, husbands will beat wives. The plague and the flux will take more lives than all the evils of man put together.
I will strive to be a good queen. I will pursue policies that I believe to be sensible, such as persuading the Aserai and the Khuzait to accept imperial citizenship and join us rather than harass our frontiers. But I can offer no guarantee that my heir, or my heir's heir, will not be a monster.
I could marry Lucon or Gario, and save thousands of lives. But men are willing to fight for me, though it gains them nothing, for no other reason that the throne is my right. I will not betray these men.
If I win, in centuries to come, people will think back on my victory and think, "Heavens smile on those who fight for truth."
