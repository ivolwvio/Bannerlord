<!-- WELCOME TO THE AEW CONFIGURATION FILE 


I played Bannerlord a while now and I have not come across any rare weapon in any of the
vendors. This leads me to believe that rare weapons (weapons above a certain price or 
tier) will never show up. To make them obtainable without needing to resort to the cheat
mode I thought I'd add the weapons to the tournament prize pool instead. 

A nice quest would have been more interesting, but I have no idea how to create quests.


!! WORKS ONLY ON NEWLY CREATED TOURNAMENTS !!
Tournaments that already existed when you enabled the mod will not be affected. Enable the
helper messages (ShowAEWPrizeMessages) if you want to see if the mod works correctly.


In this config file you have the following options:

EnableTournamentPrizes
**********************
Possible values: true, false

Setting this option to "true" allows the AEW weapons to show up in tournaments as prizes.

Setting the option to false will stop AEW weapons from showing up as tournament prizes. 
All following options will have no effect when you set this to false.



ShowAEWPrizeMessages
********************
Possible values: true, false

Setting this option to "true" will enable ingame messages anytime a weapon has been added 
to a tournament with the town in which he tournament is held (in case you still have 
trouble finding the weapons you can enable this as a helper).
Setting it to "false" disables those messages. The event will still be logged in the 
AEW.debug.log file in the /Config folder for analysis/debugging purposes.



TournamentPrizeChance
*********************
possible values: 0.00 to 100.00 (decimals are optional, so 5 is the same as 5.00)

Here you can set the chance an AEW weapon is used a tournament prize. Setting it to 100
will make every tournament prize an AEW weapon.
