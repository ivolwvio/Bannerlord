  <HotkeyInstructions>Choose from any of the labels in the "KeyIdentifiers" list to specify a key binding in the "MomentaryBannerToggleKey" or "StickyBannerToggleKey" settings. If the "UseGameShowIndicatorsBindingForMomentary" setting is set to "true", then the "MomemtaryBannerToggleHotkey" will be ignored, and it will instead use whatever key is bound to "Show Indicators" in the game settings. In any case where a key is bound to functions in both the mod and the game, it will then perform both the mod function and the game function simultaneously. The names are case sensitive, and must be entered exactly as listed. The "D1" through "D0" keys are the numeric keys on the main keyboard, and I think the rest should be self-explanatory.</HotkeyInstructions>

  <BannerScalingInstructions>The "BannerScaleFactor" option controls the normal banner size, and can be set from 0.1, which is 1/10th normal size, up to 1.0, which would be normal size.  The "SelectedBannerScaleFactor" controls the size of the banners with the outer yellow circle for selected troops.  This scaling works differently than the normal banner size, and unfortunately can never be made smaller than the original size.  Instead, it controls the extra enlargement of selected troop banners that occurs with more distant troops, to make it easier to see the selected troops when they're farther away.  The default value is 30, and this will result in the selected banners being enlarged by the usual amount.  It can be lowered down to 1, which will result in the distant banners not being enlarged at all, or increased to 60, which will enlarge them twice as much as usual.  Values lower than 1 have no effect, so the selected troop banners can never be made smaller than the original size.  (I find that a value of 0.5 for the "BannerScaleFactor" and 15 for the "SelectedBannerScaleFactor" seems to work pretty well for making the banners less obtrusive.)  Since the patches required to achieve the banner scaling are more invasive and more likely to break with future game updates, I added another config option called "ApplyBannerScalingMod" that must be changed to "true" for banner scaling to happen at all.  If the banner scaling causes a future version of the game to crash or throw an exception, you can change setting back to "false" and then the banner scaling patches will not be applied at all.</BannerScalingInstructions>
