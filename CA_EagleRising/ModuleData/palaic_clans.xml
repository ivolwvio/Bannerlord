	Patriarch - Rendric.	Wealthy, entitled clan. Duc de Berry	
	Rendric of the House of Tir is wealthy and notoriously avaricious, known for squeezing every last denar out of his subjects while neglecting his duty to defend them. His son meanwhile is considered depraved, and is almost as greatly feared as the Sturgian and Battanian raiders who he allows the rampage through the northlands as he pursues his desires. Rendric's daughter Liena is considered the saving grace of the family, who has donned armor and taken on the responsibilities that her male relatives neglect.
	Heir is Furenhard - depraved and feared
	Heiress is Liena, leads armies, somewhat feckless
	Lieutenant -

	Calatild was her father's only child, and was named heir of the House of Arromanc in contrary to normal Vlandian custom. The claim to her lands staked by Ingalther of Cortain has allowed her to rally her relatives to her banner, overcoming any objections they might have to a female liege.

	Fourth clan
	Ingalther, lord of the House of Cortain, seized his estate from a much older illegitimate half-brother. His ambition and sense of entitlement is extreme even by Vlandian standards. He has a dynastic claim to Arromanc lands, and has been pressing Derther to disinherit Calatild and award her lands to him. Derthert has of course refused, as this would both start a war with the Arromancs and make Ingalther twice as powerful as the king, but Ingalther nonetheless greatly resents him for it. Ingalther keeps close ties with the Free Company, a notoriously rapacious band of mercenaries whose seaside castle lies near his domains.
